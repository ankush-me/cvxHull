\maketitle

In the dead-week and after finals, I had some free time and hence I thought that it would be fun to implement the convex-hull algorithm for higher dimensions, as it is one of the most important alogrithms. I implemented the algorithm for three-dimensions.\\

I followed the description in the Dutch book and online references. I am representing the subdivision using a DCEL structure\footnote{ I tried using quad-edges but always ran into some bug; I guess I need to think about quad-edges more deeply.}. I am also using the conflict graph to get expected $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ time.\\

The algorithm runs pretty fast (but not quite as fast as my delaunay implementation). The following are its run-times on different sizes of randomly generated points; it was ran on my laptop running which has \texttt{Intel® Core™ i3 CPU M 350 @ 2.27GHz} processor and $4$GB RAM.

\end{center}


\subsection*{Lifting Maps}
I also ran the algorithm on parabolically lifted 2d-points. The convex-hulls indeed look similar to delaunay triangulations! Below are some screenshots. The 3d convex hull was visualized using OpenSceneGraph,
